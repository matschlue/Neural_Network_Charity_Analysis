# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Creation of a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? 
  - IS_SUCCESSFUL
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  - AFFILIATION, APPLICATION_TYPE, ASK_AMT, CLASSIFICATION, INCOME_AMT, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, USE_CASE,SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
  - EIN, NAME 

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
